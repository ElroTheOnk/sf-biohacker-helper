# Starfinder Biohacker Helper

This module provides two macros and a number of simple effect items to provide very minor automation to the biohacker's boosters & inhibitors.

To setup:
1) Add the Biohacks item to the biohacker [drag n drop from compendium to actor's features tab] to create the actor resource
2) (If necessary) Edit the new Biohacks actor resource to have the correct maximum & current value for your biohacker
3) (Optional) Drag the two biohacker macros from the compendium to the macro bar for easy access

To use:
1) Select the biohacker and target the recipient of the biohack. Then run the Biohacker Booster or Biohacker Inhibitor macro as desired.

The items contain some modifiers where simple to automate. Durations will need to be manually tracked, and the number of biohacks remaining manually reset on a 10-min or overnight rest.
