# Starfinder Biohacker Helper

This module provides two macros and a number of simple effect items to provide very minor automation to the biohacker's boosters & inhibitors.

To use, select the biohacker and target the recipient of the biohack. Then run the Biohacker Booster or Biohacker Inhibitor macro as desired.

The items contain some modifiers where simple to automate. Durations will need to be manually tracked.
